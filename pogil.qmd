# About POGIL

POGIL is an acronym for Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning.

During these activities, we will form teams of three:
- a programmer (runs the exercises in Thonny)
- a recorder (writes the team's answers to the exercises)
- a manager/presenter (keeps the team on track; interacts with class)

You can write the exercises in paper or generate a pdf to fill. Just don't forget to share it with your teammates after class!
