> Lord, you rule the world with a good and rightful code.\
We ask for your wisdom to see things correctly and represent them faithfully.\
Fill us with your justice so that we may know how to reflect it in the way we code,\
Give us humility so that we may know the limits of our knowledge and its application in society,\
Give us the courage to stand firmly when we feel pressured to go beyond these limits,\
And give us responsibility as rulers we may be in the areas of society where you put us.\
\
Lord, we want to reflect your good rule, so that people of all nations may fear your name.\
Make known to us the path of life;\
For in your presence there is fullness of joy;\
and at your right hand are pleasures forevermore (Psalm 16).\
Amen.
