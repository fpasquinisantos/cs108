> Lord, you reveal your glory in every thing you made \
Let us today engage with this creation so that we may participate in your beauty and wisdom \
May the technology we use or even develop point us toward that, \
Instead of dragging us towards our own vicious desires and illusions of freedom \
Help us, and our society, to know your ways and be still, for yours is the glory \
And our hearts are restless till they find rest in You. \
Amen.
