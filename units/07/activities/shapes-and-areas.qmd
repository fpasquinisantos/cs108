# Exercise: shapes and areas

- Let's implement a general class called `Shape` and two subclasses called `Circle` and `Rectangle`
  - Overload the `__eq__` operator to compare the shapes' areas
  - Override the constructor methods: `Rectangle` should have `width` and `height`, and `Circle` should have `radius`
  - Write methods that calculate the areas of the shapes. When you have only the generic `Shape` object, area should be equal to zero.
  - what about trying to implement the rendering of these shapes with turtle graphics?
