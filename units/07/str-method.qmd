# The `__str__` method

- This method is usually implemented to returns a string representation of an objectâ€™s state.
  - Attention: you don't "print", you just return a string!
  - When you call "print" with your object, it will "convert" it to a string representation

```{python}
class Dog():
  
  def __str__(self):
    return f'breed: {self.breed}, age: {self.age}, color: {self.color}'
  
a = Dog()
a.breed = 'boxer'
a.age = '2'
a.color = 'white'
print(str(a))
print(a)
```
