# Constructor method: `__init__()`

- The special method `__init__` is important in almost class. It is called the constructor method and runs automatically when user instantiates an object.
- It is important to include the `self` parameter - this refers to the object itself!

```{python}
class Dog(): # definition of the class ("blueprint")
  
  def __init__(self, breed, age, color):
    self.breed = breed
    self.age = age
    self.color = color
    
    
# main code chunk
a = Dog('pug', 3, 'black')
b = Dog('boxer', 2, 'white')
print(a.breed)
```
