# Class methods and variables
- You can declare variables and methods that are pertaining to the class itself, not to specific instances. In that case, you just don't use the parameter `self`.
- To use those, you don't call the method on the object (like `x.method()`), but on the class itself (like `Dog.average_color`).

- Following our last example:

```{python}
class Dog():
  
  max_age = 20
  
  def average_color(c1, c2):
    return c1 + ' and ' + c2


print(Dog.max_age)
print(Dog.average_color('black','white'))
```
