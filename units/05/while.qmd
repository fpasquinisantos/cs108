# While loops {data-stack-name="while"}

-   Conditional iteration tests a condition to determine if a loop
    should continue
-   Called **continuation condition**

```{python}

## Examples

```{python}
x = 10
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x = x - 1
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
count = 0
while (count < 10):
   # Point A
   print ("OlÃ¡...", count)
   count = count + 1
   # Point B
# Point C
```

Consider the following affirmations and say if they are right or wrong:

1.  `count < 10` is always `True` at point C.
2.  `count < 10` is always `False` at point B.
3.  `count < 10` is always `True` at point A.
4.  `count < 10` is always `False` at point C.
5.  `count < 10` is always `True` at point B.
