# For loops {.smaller data-stack-name="for"}

```{python}
#| eval: false
for variable in <container>:
    <loop statements>
```

-   This code will repeat through each item in the container (list,
    tuple, set, etc)
    -   `variable` is declared at the loop and will only be available
        inside the loop.
    -   Its value will vary with each iteration, assuming the current
        value in the sequence/container
-   Like the while loop, statements in the for loop body must be
    indented and aligned in the same column!

## Examples

```{python}
for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Zuki","Thandi",'Joe']:
    print("Hi", name, "how are you?")
```

```{python}
for val in (3, 11, 22, 0, -3):
    print(val)
```
