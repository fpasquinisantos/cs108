# Break and continue

-   A `break` statement in a loop causes an immediate exit of the loop.

```{python}
#| eval: false
sum = 0.0
while True:
    data = input('Enter a number: ')
    if data == '':
        break
    sum += float(data)
print('The sum is', sum)
```

```{python}
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i==2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

- Breaks and continues can sometimes simplify a loop's structure and improve readability!
