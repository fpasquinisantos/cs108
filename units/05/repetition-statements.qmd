# Repetition statements

-   Natural and computer languages can describe things that are repeated.

> "For the LORD is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations." Psalm 100?5

-   In computer science, repetition is portrayed with the metaphor of a loop.

> One aspect of the LOOP, and in many ways its defining quality, is the minimal means that result in automated infinite production. Is it when writing a simple FOR statement for the first time, counting to, say, 10 and printing 
to the screen at each iteration, that the novice programmer “Beheld the living traces and the sky-pointing proportions of the mighty Pan”? \

### How we we rule with loops?

-   Every time we use a loop, we are pronouncing a judgment about **what similar and what is different**.
-   Every time we use a loop, we are pronouncing a judgment about **what can be scaled**.

## Two types of loops

1. **Definite iteration**: Loops that repeat a predefined number of times - the FOR statement
2. **Indefinite iteration**: Loops that continue until a condition occurs - the WHILE statement
    
> "Although often interchangeable, FOR is like a tourist that knows when it will 
be home (but with the power to RETURN earlier), WHILE is like a traveller 
away for as long as there is no hard reason to come back, potentially forever." \
