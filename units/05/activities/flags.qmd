# Pattern: flags {.smaller data-stack-name="flags"}

-   A flag is a programming pattern: a **boolean variable** that acts as
    a signal to the program to determine whether or not the program as a
    whole or a specific section of the program should run.
    -   For example, you can set the flag to `True` and the program will
        run continuously until any type of event makes it `False`. Then
        the program, loop, or whatever you're using a flag for will
        stop, or do something else.

## What are the flags in this code?

```{python}
#| eval: false
newlist = []
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
newlist.append(number)
ascending = True
descending = True
while True:
    next_number = input("Enter a number: ")
    if next_number == '':
        break
    if int(next_number) < number:
        ascending = False
    else:
        descending = False
    newlist.append(int(next_number))
    number = int(next_number)
if ascending:
    print("Sequence is in ascending order")
elif descending:
    print("Sequence is in descending order")
else:
    print("Sequence is not ordered")
```
