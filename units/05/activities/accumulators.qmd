# Pattern: accumulator {data-stack-name="accumulators"}

-   An **accumulator** is the name we give to a variable that is updated
    at each loop.
-   For example, identify the accumulator variables in the following
    code:

```{python}
#| eval: false
product = 1
count = 0
while count < 5:
  number = int(input("Enter an integer:"))
  product *= number
print("The total product is", product)
```

## Example: Fibonacci sequence

```{python}
#| eval: false
acc1 = 1
acc2 = 1
fib = [1, 1]
length_fib = 10
i = 1
while i < length_fib:
    next_number = acc1 + acc2
    fib.append(next_number)
    acc1 = acc2
    acc2 = next_number
    i += 1
print("The Fibonnaci sequence is", fib)
```
