## Grace Hopper's proposal {data-name="programming language"}

-   Later, in 1949, Grace Hopper invented the first programming language: COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language)
    -   For example, the user would write:
        `COMPUTE SUM = (1 + 3)`
        `DIVIDE SUM BY 2 GIVING AVERAGE`
        
-   Crucial to this was the development of the **compiler**: a program capable of converting a sentence very much like an English phrase (with syntax and semantics) into machine instructions.

## So, what's a code?

-   "A program that follows a set of rules" (in order to be correctly interpreted)
-   To learn how to program, then, is to learn **how to express yourself correctly through the code**
    -   Notice the origin of the word - [codex](https://www.britannica.com/topic/codex-manuscript)
