Try:

-   Saving some previous code as `program.py`
-   Open a command-line interface in your computer and run: `python3 program.py`
    -   You need to have python3 installed in your machine
    -   You need to be in the directory of the file `program.py`

Python can be run in two modes:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Script / Program

-   All lines of code executed without stop
-   Run in command-line as `python3 program.py`
-   Only print what is specifically passed through `print()`

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Interactive shell

-   Run lines of code each at a time, as user enters them
-   Open in command-line just by typing `python3`
-   Typing an expression without being assigned to a variable will "print" the result

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE) {data-name="IDE"}

-   In our classes, we will be using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/)
    -   Notice the panels for scripting and for interactive shell
    -   There is also a helper and variable explorer for debugging code
