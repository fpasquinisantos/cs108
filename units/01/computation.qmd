## Automatic computation {data-name="automatic computation"}

-   Charles Babbage is known for developing the first automatic computer machine (1820's)
    -   "the faster and more reliably one could calculate, the more money businesses could make."

-   Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, became enamoured by Babbage's machine and developed the first **algorithm**, to calculate a sum of numbers:

## Algorithm {data-name="algorithm"}

-   Basically, a program: a description of a series of operations.
-   But with some specific features:
    1.  Precise and unambiguous steps
    2.  Definite results
    3.  Finite
    4.  Generalizable (works with a range of possible inputs)
    5.  Usually expressed through abstract/mathematical notation

## STEM today is programming computations {data-name="STEM programming"}

-   For complex calculations, we don't rely anymore on pressing calculator buttons. We have to make automatic computation programs
