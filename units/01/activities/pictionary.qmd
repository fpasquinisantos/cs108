# The pictionary game

-   How difficult it is to describe to someone how to draw something?
    -   Instructions may be ambiguous
    -   Different backgrounds, ways of interpreting...
-   So happens with programming. The drama of programming is the drama of all human communication/expression...

## Example: Drawing a rectangle

-   Say to a computer **"Draw a red rectangle in the top left corner of the screen."**

    -   What shade of red, precisely?
    -   How big should the rectangle be?
    -   Exactly in the top left, or with some padding, and how much?
    -   When should it be drawn?
    -   What is the "top" of the screen on a mobile device that can be rotated?

-   Code in Javascript:

```{javascript}
// Get the canvas on the webpage that we want to render to.
let c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
// Ask the canvas for an object that knows how to render 2-dimensional graphics onto the canvas.
let renderer = c.getContext("2d");
// Set the color to render, then draw a 100 x 100 pixel rectangle.
renderer.fillStyle = "rgb(255, 0, 0)";
renderer.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
```

-   Notice that many things that do not matter when we give instructions to other people actually do matter for the computer. And vice-versa...
    -   Why is that?
