Interaction rips computation out of the clean room of the algorithm and 
thrusts it into the tainted and unpredictable space of dynamic and shared 
environment.
Interaction forces a rethinking of algorithmic approaches toward those that 
perform a kind of dance alternating between active computation and responsive strategies to a changing environment.
Embracing interaction requires the programmer or designer to break open 
the black boxes of algorithmic processes and acknowledge the incompleteness 
of what they create in the pursuit of experiences that are playful, insightful, 
and potentially surprising. - Michael Murtaugh, Software studies
