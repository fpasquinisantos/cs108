# Nested ifs {data-name="nested ifs"}

-   You can also "nest" an if inside another:

```{python}
#| eval: false
if age > 12:
   if age < 20:
     print('teenager')
   else:
      print('adult')
else:
   print('child')
```

-   Note that, in this case, whatever is "inside" the two ifs must be indented twice!
