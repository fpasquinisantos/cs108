# Multi-way selection {data-name="elif"}

-   You can also use the word `elif` in case you need to check a condition after other condition is `False`. In this way, we have multiple branches, for more than two alternatives.

```{python}
#| eval: false
if grade >= 90:
    print('A')
elif grade >= 80:
    print('B')
elif grade >= 70:
    print('C')
elif grade >= 60:
    print('D')
else:
    print('F')
```
