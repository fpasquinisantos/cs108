# Exercises

## Exercise 1: if versus elif

-   What is the difference between an `elif` and a `if` just after another `if`?

```{python}
x = 4
if x > 3:
  print("Greater than 3")
elif x < 5:
  print("Less than 5")
```

```{python}
x = 4
if x > 3:
  print("Greater than 3")
if x < 5:
  print("Less than 5")
```




## Exercise 2

```{python}
#| eval: false
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
choice = input("Choose between square, circle or both: ")
if choice.lower() == "square" or choice.lower() == "both":
  turtle.forward(100)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(100)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(100)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(100)
if choice.lower() == "circle" or choice.lower() == "both":
  turtle.circle(50)
print("Finished!")
```

-   Which code chunks will execute:
    -   If the user types `square`?
    -   If the user types `both`?
    -   If the user types `potato`?
-   Why are we setting `choice.lower()` in the comparison?

## Exercise 3

-   Identify the code chunks and write its fluxogram (note the nested ifs!)

```{python}
#| eval: false
print("Lamp doesn't work!")
ans = input("Is the lamp plugged in? ")
if ans == "yes":
  ans = input("Is the bulb burned out? ")
  if ans == "yes":
    print("Replace bulb!")
  else:
    print("Repair lamp!")
else:
  print("Plug in lamp!")
```
