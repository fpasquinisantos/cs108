# If statement

-   Until now we have been only looking at a sequential, step-by-step program flow.
-   What if we want our code to execute different code given some conditions?

-   In Python, an if statement takes the following form:

```{python}
#| eval: false
x=1
if expression:
  # statements executed if expression is true
# statements following the if expression (execute independently of expression being true or false)
```

-   Attention to **indentation**: all lines that will be executed if the expression is true must start with a "tab" or 4 whitespaces

-   Lines of code that are not indented ("inside the if") just are followed after it is finished
