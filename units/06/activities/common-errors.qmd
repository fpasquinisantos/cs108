# Exercises: where are the errors?

- What are the problems in the following code and how can we correct them?

```{python}
#| eval: false
def xyz(p1, 'hello'):
    print(p1)
```

- PS: *printing a value in a function is not the same thing as returning it*
  - What is the difference between printing and returning?
  
- Now, repeat with these (point error and correct it):

```{python}
#| eval: false
x1 = int(input())
x2 = int(input())
res = add(x1, x2)
print("The sum is: ", res)

def add(a, b):
  c = a + b
  return c
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
def fun(x):
  print(x, end=' ')
  fun(x-1)

fun(10)
```
