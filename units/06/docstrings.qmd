# Docstrings {.smaller data-stack-name="docstrings"}

- The PEP8 standard requires **docstrings** for functions, describing what the function does. 
  - This comment should appear after the `def` line
  - The `'''` that ends a multiline docstring should be on a line by itself
  - These docstrings can be accessed in many IDEs, facilitating development

```{python}
def cube_volume(side_length):
    ''' Compute the volume of a cube
        Parameter: side_length is side length of cube
        returns: volume
    '''
    volume = side_length ** 3
    return volume
```
