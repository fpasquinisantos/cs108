# Abstraction {.smaller data-stack-name="abstraction"}

-   Abstraction is the process of ignoring details to focus on the big picture

    -   Most people don't know how a TV works, but they can still use it
    -   A TV can be abstracted as box with inputs and outputs as follows:

- Abstractions hide the details and make your solutions reach other people.
  - Example: prefab mods in building games - you download the item and create it in your game.
