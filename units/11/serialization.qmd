CSV files

Pro: tabular data to share with others
Cons: can’t store nested data; reader has to guess data types (e.g., Bar Harbor, Maine has ZIP code 4609?)
sometimes better to use Excel (XLSX)
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files

Pros: Used a lot for APIs because…
Can store nested objects (e.g., board game states)
Looks like normal Python (actually, JavaScript) code
Fast; lots of programming languages can work with it
Con:
few applications can work with them
Pickle
